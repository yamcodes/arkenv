1. Copy the example environment file:

   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and set your `BUN_PUBLIC_MY_VALUE`:
   ```
   BUN_PUBLIC_MY_VALUE=Your custom value here
   ```

3. The environment variable will be displayed in the "Environment Variables" section of the app.

**Note:** In Bun, client-side environment variables must be prefixed with `BUN_PUBLIC_` to be accessible in the browser.
