> [!NOTE]
> This is a version of the [basic example](https://github.com/yamcodes/arkenv/tree/main/examples/basic) that works on Stackblitz.
> We changed a bunch of things, like the way we run the script from `tsx` to `ts-node` to make it work on Stackblitz on Firefox, where WebAssembly Core is still in beta.
> We changed a few more things to make it work on Stackblitz. Please head over to [examples/basic](https://github.com/yamcodes/arkenv/tree/main/examples/basic) for an actual basic example of how to use ArkEnv.
