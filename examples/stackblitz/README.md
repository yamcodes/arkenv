# ArkEnv basic example (Stackblitz)

This example shows how to use ArkEnv in a basic Node.js application.

> [!NOTE]
> This example is adapted for StackBlitz compatibility. It includes a few adjustments (like using `ts-node` instead of `tsx`) to work around current limitations in [stackblitz/webcontainer-core](https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-core).
>
> For the canonical minimal setup, see [examples/basic](../basic).
