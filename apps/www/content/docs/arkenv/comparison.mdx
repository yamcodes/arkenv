## Detailed comparisons

### DIY

You'd be surprised how easy it is to write a simple environment variable validation flow with any of the popular validation libraries. To show this, we will naturally use ArkType, but you can use any of the popular alternatives.
Just create a `env.ts` file that defines the schema, runs a simple check and returns the validated environment variables.

```ts
import { type } from "arktype";

const Env = type({
	PORT: type("string.integer.parse").to("0 <= number <= 65535").default("3000"),
	NODE_ENV: "'development' | 'production' | 'test' = 'development'",
});

export const env = Env.assert(process.env);
```

That's it. You're done.

Who needs ArkEnv, right?

On first glance, this gets you what you need: validation, typesafety, defaultability, and even type morphs!

However, you will quickly realize that this starts looking messier when you start getting out of that "Hello world!" realm:

* You have to write each morph manually. Since `process.env` is a record of strings, each non-string you'll want (number, boolean) requires you to parse it yourself. This can get tedious. ArkEnv includes [coercion](/docs/arkenv/coercion) out of the box.
* With most validation libraries, the default error message is too verbose and clogs your terminal. ArkEnv provides a concise error flow that is tailored for the environment variables usecase.
* Even though this code is simple, if you manage multiple projects, you'll find yourself writing a similar flow again and again. With ArkEnv, you'll likely get your needs met with a simple `arkenv()` call.
* This code does not work well for frontend apps built with Vite and Bun, where environment variables are statically replaced and not available to view in a simple `process.env` object call. ArkEnv provides plugins for both of these frameworks with solutions for each.

After working in enterprise for years, I found myself reaching for a simple, well tested, and complete solution that solves these issues. ArkEnv is that solution.

### T3 Env

[T3 Env](https://env.t3.gg) is a wonderful library actively maintained by the T3 team. In many ways it's an inspiration to ArkEnv, although our codebases are different and the mental model is different.

T3 Env is built for Next.js first: environment variables are split into client and server (even in the agnostic core, you'll still put your variables in a `server` key), and it has many settings for that purpose.
It also has a Nuxt plugin.

#### If you're writing a Next.js or Nuxt app

You should use T3 Env. ArkEnv does not have integrations for either of those frameworks. 

There are other options for these frameworks too, but T3 Env is battle tested, has a large community, and well documented.

#### If you're not wrting a Next.js or a Nuxt app

If you're writing a Vite app, a standard Bun or Node.js (backend) app, a CLI, a Bun fullstack app, or even a Solid Start app, you should probably use ArkEnv.

Even if you don't use ArkType, or not completely at least (like a phased in migration), you should still probably use ArkEnv, since we support Standard Schema. That means you can use ArkEnv even if you're used to Zod, Valibot, and other Standard Schema-supported validators.

If you do switch to ArkEnv, you'll enjoy features like coercion and first class ArkType support (for when you finally make the switch) that are missing from T3 Env.

### vite-plugin-validate-env

[@julr/vite-plugin-validate-env](https://github.com/julien-r44/vite-plugin-validate-env) is a Vite plugin that validates environment variables at build time. It uses a built-in validator or any Standard Schema validator (Zod, Valibot, etc.).

I really like this plugin and use it in production code. It's a solid tool for simple usecases that specifically include Vite.

However, whether you're writing a Vite app or not, you should strongly consider switching to ArkEnv. We offer a [first class Vite plugin](/docs/arkenv/vite-plugin) that provides the same functionality as this plugin, but with additional features like coercion and first class ArkType support.

Also, at the time of this writing, `@julr/vite-plugin-validate-env` does not offer a documented way to typesafe environment variables in your Vite config. ArkEnv's Vite plugin has [a clear guide](/docs/vite-plugin/arkenv-in-viteconfig) written exactly for this usecase. 

### znv

[znv](https://github.com/lostfictions/znv) is a simple, zero dependency environment variable validator that uses Zod under the hood.

I myself have used it for years and I really like its coercion feature, which inspired ArkEnv's coercion.

ArkEnv includes all of znv's features out of the box, and supports other validators than Zod thanks to Standard Schema support. This incldues ArkType (naturally), but also Valibot and others.

Also, znv does not offer a Vite or a Bun plugin, so if you're on those frameworks, you should use ArkEnv instead of wiring things up manually or using 2 different libraries.

### envalid

[envalid](https://github.com/af/envalid) is the cadillac of environment variable validators.

It's the most popular of the alternatives listed here, it's battle tested, and has a large community.

On the other hand, it does not support modern validation libraries (without manual wiring), and does not support most modern frameworks out of the box.

Unless you're maintaining legacy code, you should strongly consider switching to ArkEnv.

### dotenv-safe

Although not type validator, I'm including [dotenv-safe](https://github.com/rolodato/dotenv-safe) here for completeness. 

All it does is take your `.env.example` file and check if all values listed there are found in your `.env` file.

If all you're looking for is a yes/no answer to "are all my environment variables set?", this is the tool for you.

If you need more than that (typesafety features, default values, framework integrations), you should probably consider ArkEnv.
