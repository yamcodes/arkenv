## The ArkEnv icon 


<img src="/assets/icon.svg" alt="ArkEnv icon" width="128" height="128"/>


The ArkEnv icon tells the story of what we're building. It weaves together three distinct symbols:

- **A gear**: At first glance, it's a settings gear, representing the core mechanical purpose of the library: precise environment configuration.
- **A ship's wheel**: Look closer, and it's a ship's wheel. This honors the Ark motif, symbolizing the freedom to explore and build, steered by reliable technology.
- **A lighthouse**: It is also the Japanese map symbol for a lighthouse. Just as a lighthouse warns sailors of danger, ArkEnv's typesafety guides your apps away from the rocky shores of runtime errors.
