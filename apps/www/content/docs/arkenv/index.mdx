## Philosophy

### Build from the core up

With most validators, it's clear that they were designed for a specific framework, the one favored by the maintainer. ArkEnv was designed to "just work" even within a simple Node.js server, no configuration needed. This core is where ArkEnv started, and it's what we continue to test and optimize for today. Any additional configuration is optional.

We layer framework integrations as optional modules (which we call "plugins") on top of this core to provide a convenient experience for your app's development. Using these integrations in modern JavaScript toolkits should feel just as simple as using the core library within a simple Node.js server.

### Fail fast

ArkEnv is built to protect your app from runtime errors as early as possible. This means that as soon as we know what the actual values are, we'll fail your app if they don't match your schema. When environment variables eventually reach runtime, you can be sure they're valid.

### Sane defaults

ArkEnv makes a few opinionated assumptions about your workflow: 

* Environment variables come from `process.env` (or `import.meta.env` in Vite)
* They start as strings but should become the types defined in your schema
* Your framework already loads `.env` files
* You're using a modern, Standard Schema-compliant validator

These defaults keep ArkEnv dead simple. If your workflow is different, you can opt out of features like type coercion, customize the env source, or extend behavior with plugins.
