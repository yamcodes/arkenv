Traditionally, environment variables are always strings by default. ArkEnv **coerces** these strings into their target types based on your schema, so you only have to think about the types you want.

## Numbers

Any field defined as a `number` or a numeric subtype (like `number.integer` or `number.port`) will be automatically parsed.

```ts title="index.ts"
import arkenv from "arkenv";

const env = arkenv({
  PORT: "number.port",
  RETRY_COUNT: "number.integer = 3",
  AGE: "0 <= number.integer <= 120"
});

// All are numbers!
console.log({
  port: env.PORT,
  retryCount: env.RETRY_COUNT,
  age: env.AGE
}); 
```

## Booleans

The `boolean` type handles strings like `"true"` and `"false"`.

```ts title="index.ts"
import arkenv from "arkenv";

const env = arkenv({
  DEBUG: "boolean = false"
});

// DEBUG is true if process.env.DEBUG is "true"
console.log({
  debug: env.DEBUG
});
```

## How it works

ArkEnv introspects your schema to identify fields that should be numbers, booleans, and other non-string types you define. When you call `createEnv()` (or `arkenv()`), it pre-processes your environment variables to perform these conversions *before* validation.

## Performance

Coercion is highly optimized: ArkEnv performs a one-time introspection of your schema to map out exactly which paths need conversion. At runtime, it only touches the variables that actually need coercion, keeping your startup time virtually identical to manually parsing `process.env`.

## Disabling coercion

You can opt-out of this behavior by setting `coerce` to `false`.

```ts title="index.ts"
import arkenv from "arkenv";

// ⚠️ This will throw an error!
// "3000" (string) is not a number.
const env = arkenv(
  {
    PORT: "number.port",
  },
  {
    coerce: false, // < -- Disable coercion
    env: {
      PORT: "3000",
    },
  }
);
```

When coercion is disabled, environment variables are validated **exactly as they are**. Since environment variables are strings, this means validation will fail for `number` or `boolean` fields unless you morph them yourself.
